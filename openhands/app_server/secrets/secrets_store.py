    This is an extension point in OpenHands that allows applications to customize how

    1. Creating a class that inherits from SecretsStore
    2. Implementing all required methods
    3. Setting server_config.secret_store_class to the fully qualified name of the class

    The class is instantiated via get_impl() in openhands.app_server.shared.py.
